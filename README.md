##### Preach:
Preach is case insensitive. In any of the following examples, replacing 'preach' with 'PREACH' or 'pReAcH' will accomplish the same results.

`preach "I am race"` will print the string "I am race" to the console, without quotes.

`preach 1926` will print the number 1926 to the console.

`preach 2015 - 89` will print the result of this expression to the console.

##### Expressions:
Currently supported mathematical expressions are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), divsion (/), and modulus (%). Expressions ignore spaces, and support parentheses. Correct order of operations applies. Print results of expressions using preach.

`preach 10 * (8 - 2)` prints 60 to the console.

`preach 10 * 8 - 2` prints 78 to the console.

##### Strings:
Strings are recognized by surrounding them with double quotes. Print strings to the console using preach.

`preach "This is a string in li0n!"` prints "This is a string in li0n!" to the console, without quotes.

Installation
------------

Installing and developing with li0n is a breeze! Here is the step-by-step process regarding the installation of li0n:

1. Get the files from GitHub onto your computer, either by cloning the repository or downloading and extracting the .zip file.
2. Open li0n.py and test.lang in your text editor of choice (We use Sublime Text, primarily)
3. Ensure that Python is installed on your computer. If not, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and report back.

And that's it! Now you are on your way to becoming a full fledged li0n developer! Play around with the Python interpreter and the source .lang file and see what you can do!

To run the li0n interpreter on your source file:

1. Open your command line, and change directory into the location of li0n.py and test.lang
2. Run the command `python3 li0n.py test.lang` (or the names of your files, if you renamed them)
3. Marvel at your amazing li0n development!
